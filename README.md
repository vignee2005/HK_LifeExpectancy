# HongKong_LifeExpectancy
Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, is a highly developed, densely populated urban center located on the southern coast of China. It became a Special Administrative Region of China in 1997 when sovereignty was transferred from the United Kingdom to China, under the principle of "one country, two systems." This arrangement allows Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy, including its legal and economic systems, for 50 years after the handover.
