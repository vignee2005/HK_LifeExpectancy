# HongKong_LifeExpectancy
In trying to explain why Hong Kong of China ranks highest in life expectancy in the world, we review what various experts are hypothesizing, and how data science methods may be used to provide more evidence-based conclusions. While more data become available, we find some data analysis studies were too simplistic, while others too overwhelming in answering this challenging question. We find the approach that analyzes life expectancy related data (mortality causes and rate for different cohorts) inspiring, and use this approach to study a carefully selected set of targets for comparison. In discussing the factors that matter, we argue that it is more reasonable to try to identify a set of factors that together explain the phenomenon.
Hong Kong, as a Special Administrative Region of China, has consistently ranked among the top in global life expectancy statistics, with an impressive figure of 85.16 years recorded in 2022. This phenomenon has garnered significant attention from various sectors, sparking discussions, analyses, and inquiries into the underlying factors contributing to Hong Kong's exceptional longevity.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, ranging from medical and healthcare-related factors to socio-cultural and environmental influences. These hypotheses include factors such as ease of mobility, green environment, efficient healthcare systems, healthy lifestyle choices, and strong familial support systems. While these hypotheses provide plausible explanations, a comprehensive understanding requires rigorous data analysis and validation.
The project aims to delve deeper into the reasons behind Hong Kong's high life expectancy through a multidisciplinary approach. By employing data science methodologies, statistical analyses, and stakeholder engagements, the project seeks to identify and evaluate the key determinants shaping life expectancy in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the project aims to provide evidence-based insights to inform public health policies and initiatives aimed at promoting longevity and well-being in Hong Kong and beyond.
